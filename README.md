# What is anansi?

It is a markdown parser, my aim is to parse markdown documents into an AST and use a structured query language to extract structured data from the documents.

For example the query language would let you query:

- give me a list of all link elements that follow a bold element
- give me a list of all the urls from the image elements

The query language will not be in natural language. It will look more like SQL but i haven't designed that yet.
